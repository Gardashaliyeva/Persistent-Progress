This app helps you build and track positive habits over a chosen period. 
You start by selecting how many days you want your streak to last. Once selected, you'll see a series of blocks, one for each day.

When you click on any day's block, a detailed view opens up, allowing you to:
* **Add General Tasks:** List any daily tasks you want to accomplish.
* **Manage Prayer Time Tasks:** Add specific tasks for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha, and even set timers for them.
* **Include Recurring Tasks:** Add tasks that you want to repeat daily.
* **Keep a Journal:** Write down your most important religious learning, worldly achievements, and moments of gratitude for that day.
* **Set a Daily Goal:** Define a "Completion Threshold" â€“ the number of tasks you aim to complete for that day.

As you complete tasks, you can check them off. The app automatically tracks your progress, and if you meet or exceed your daily goal, that day's block will turn green. If not, it will turn red, giving you a clear visual of your streak's status. All your tasks, progress, and journal entries are automatically saved, so your data is always there when you return to the app.
